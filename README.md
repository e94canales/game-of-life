## About the Game of Life

Conway's Game of Life is a cellular automaton that was created by John Horton Conway in 1970. It is played by simply inputting a pattern on a 2-D grid and letting it run on it's own. There are also predefined presets already made to ease in this process. There are rules that are responsible for the way the "cells" get manipulated.

### Rules

[] Any live cell with fewer than two live neighbours dies, as if by underpopulation.
[] Any live cell with two or three live neighbours lives on to the next generation.
[] Any live cell with more than three live neighbours dies, as if by overpopulation.
[] Any dead cell with exactly three live neighbours becomes a live cell, as if by reproduction.
